<<< Demonstration (teaching) >>>
--------------------------------

Demonstration involves showing by reason or proof, explaining or making clear by
use of examples or experiments. Put more simply, demonstration means 'to clearly show'.

In teaching through demonstration, students are set up to potentially conceptualize
class material more effectively as shown in a study which specifically focuses on
chemistry demonstrations presented by teachers. Demonstrations often occur when
students have a hard time connecting theories to actual practice or when students
are unable to understand application of theories.

Teachers not only demonstrate specific learning concepts within the classroom,
they can also participate in demonstration classrooms to help improve their own
teaching strategies, which may or may not be demonstrative in nature. Although
the literature is limited, studies show that the effects of demonstration classroom
teachers includes a change of perspective in relating to students, more reflection
in the teachersâ€™ own classroom strategies, and more personal responsibility for
student learning.
